## Docker file for minimal alpine based jdk9 container.


To build this container, you need to download openjdk9 for alpine linux from here: http://jdk.java.net/9/ and place it next to this Dockerfile.
Once this is done, you can build and push this container somewhere and use it for further jdk9 customizations.

Alternatively you can pull it from my dockerhub: dekstroza/openjdk9-alpine:latest
